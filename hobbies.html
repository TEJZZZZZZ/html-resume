
<h2>My Hobbies!!</h2>
<h5>
    <p>I wander through the songs I play,<br/>
    Where silent thoughts are swept away.<br/>
    With brush and paint, in colors bright,<br/>
    I turn my silence into light.</p>

    <p>In lines of code, my thoughts align,<br/>
    Logic and dreams in neat design.<br/>
    Each problem solved, each error healed,<br/>
    A world of answers is revealed.</p>

    <p>I walk alone where roads unfold,<br/>
    A solo heart, yet brave and bold.<br/>
    Though friends are few, my roots run strong,<br/>
    My family's love—where I belong.</p>

    <p>The journey flows where dreams agree,<br/>
    With every step discovering me.</p>
