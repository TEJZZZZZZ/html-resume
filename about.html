<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a student who believes life works best when logic meets rhythm. By day, I explore the world of coding; by heart, I move through music and dance. Calm in nature yet ambitious in spirit, I enjoy hosting events and bringing energy, stories, and people together. Traveling fuels my creativity, offering new perspectives that shape how I think, create, and grow. With a hardworking mindset and a love for expression, I'm on a journey to craft experiences that leave a lasting impression—both on screen and beyond.</p>
